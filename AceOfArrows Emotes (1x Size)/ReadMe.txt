This is a library of ALL of the emotes that have been used on my channel lately, save for AceGG and AceHype, which have been outdated/deprecated.

If you are using BetterDiscord, many of my emotes will work fine; some won't (described below).  To force other stuff to work, after installing BetterDiscord, you want to take the following steps:

1) Stick the ImageEmote.js in your AppData -> Roaming -> BetterDiscord -> Plugins folder.

2) Force a refresh of Discord so BD loads the plugin (Ctrl + R).

3) Go into your Settings, click the Better Discord tab, and enable the plugin.

4) Add rows to the plugin for each emote call you want to include.  What you need is the call, and the Base64 info for the file (yes, not the image itself); go to this website:
http://jpillora.com/base64-encoder/
And stick any emotes you need encoded in there.  Copy the ENTIRE coding for each emote into the second column.

From now on, any emotes added this way will appear when you /slashcommand call them properly.  Others will also be able to see these images.

Emotes That Don't Work on Better Discord
----------------------------------------
These are emotes you need to force in through Image Emote; ALL emotes not listed work fine and will display inline.  These will need called by command when you want to use them as part of the Image Emote plugin.
